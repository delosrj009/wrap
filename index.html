                  This section was designed to be a collage but I wanted to put
                  captions on each image so it turned out this way. So, this is
                  now called image cards printed by an instant camera. Some of
                  the images are scenes that tells a memory because half of our
                  pictures have been deleted. I tried to say whatever it's in my
                  mind. They represent what I thought about the little moments
                  we have had while we still saw each other. Good bye mai, i
                  know i cannot be forgiven. God knows I've been very desperate
                  for these past few months. I only made this because I want to
                  make peace for myself. I hope you find your own peace. I'm
                  grateful for all these years beside you.
